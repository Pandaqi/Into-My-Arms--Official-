**Intro / Outro**

**PRE-GAME:**

Text fades in/out, slowly moves across screen.

Images above it.

-   Once upon a time, two cubitos were in love ... (Get it? Cubito => cube + cupido)

-   They wanted to hug, they wanted to dance, yet ...

-   They never got the chance

-   Or, as that witch liked to say, "you never TOOK your chance"

-   The witch came out of nowhere, like a silent stranger

-   She took one look, spoke magic words from a magic book, and everything started changing

-   Suddenly the two lovers could not look each other in the eye

-   Instead, the witch proclaimed, you must take a leap of faith

-   The only way to pass each stage, is stepping backwards from a great height ...

-   Falling into your lovers arms, that's how love will bloom tonight ...

**OUTRO**

-   And on that final day, the witch returned

-   You did well my darlings, but remember the lessons you have learned

-   Don't fill your heart with anger, distrust or hate

-   You'll live happily ever after ... with just a leap of faith

**Campaign**

**[World 1: Movement + Win Condition]{.underline}**

**LEVEL 0 ("Tutorial"):**

Controls are explained "in the background":

**PC/MAC/LINUX:** Above the players, some text and buttons to explain how players move/rotate

**ANDROID/iOS:** Clearly link interface buttons with players and explain with pointers what they do

**Rule #1:**

One player must step *backwards* from a height,

And *fall* on top of the other, into their arms

It's called a "leap of faith",

And the only way to win each stage

**LEVEL 1 ("No-looking rule")**

**Rule #2:**

If one player ever *sees* the other,

you will surely not succeed

For love is based on trust and touch,

And control is something she doesn't need

**LEVEL 2 ():**

**Reminder:**

You win by falling into each other's arms,

Stepping backwards from a height greater than one

For if the height difference is less than that,

It's not a *fall* that you've just done

**LEVEL 3 ():**

"We've been cursed for some time now,"

Said the red cubito

"We might not be able to see each other,

But I do need your shoulder to lean on ..."

*(To hint players that they can stand on top of each other.)*

**LEVEL 4 ():**

But the other said: "I don't know what's right,

Should I let you go or hold you tight?"

*(To hint players that they must separate from each other to win the level.)*

**LEVEL 5 ():**

"Maybe we don't need answers now,

Maybe we should just explore"

These levels may sometimes seem simple,

But hidden spots bloom within mysterious decor

**LEVEL 6 ():**

**"**Stay together or stay apart, what's the solution that lives in your heart?"

*(To hint players that they must separate from each other to win the level.)*

**[\
]{.underline}**

**[World 2: Butterflies]{.underline}**

**LEVEL 7 ():**

Butterflies in my stomach,

I'm afraid I'm madly in love

Just the thought of you,

Is enough to lift me up

**LEVEL 8 ():**

"Going up is easy,"

responded a voice

"But falling down into your arms,

That might be the harder choice"

**LEVEL 9 ():**

Sometimes things seem obvious,

I'm a fool not to see I love you dear

But standing next to you, I fear

Maybe it's too early to be "us"

**\
**

**[World 3: Buttons + Gates]{.underline}**

**LEVEL 10 ():**

So I put up walls and sturdy gates

To keep you from winning my heart

But a single push from you on the right button

Makes all these barriers fall apart

**LEVEL 11 ():**

"But from obstacles you can build bridges,

So don't blindly believe words spoken by random witches!

I believe in you, and if you believe in me,

Let me lead you to our destiny"

**LEVEL 12 ():**

Can't you see then, it is just too soon?

If I open my gates to your invitation,

And you remove your walls without hesitation,

The curse will lead us to our doom!

**[\
]{.underline}**

**[World 4: Buttons + Platforms]{.underline}**

**LEVEL 13 ():**

"It is never too soon to be in love,

only too late to ask on a date.

"I'll never give up," they said with trembling voice,

"I'll just push some more buttons and leave you no choice"

**LEVEL 14 ():**

And so, they heard the witch's whisper, the game has begun

Buttons: pushing them might just move something ... or someone

**LEVEL 15 ():**

Love is when an unstoppable force ... meets an immovable object

(*To hint players that they need to block the platform with their cubito*)

**LEVEL 16 ():**

Our love is like these platforms,

They always try to finish a perfect movement

But life rarely listens to our wishes

And can block our moves at every moment

(*To explain this mechanic, and hint again that blocking platforms is important.*)

**LEVEL 17 ():**

So maybe love is knowing

That our paths will sometimes cross

May sometimes even run parallel

But might diverge to end in loss

(*To hint players that cubitos need to cross each other, then separate again.*) => IS THIS EVEN TRUE??

**LEVEL 18 ():**

"Sometimes a single touch ... can cause many things to happen"

(*First time we see one button that moves multiple platforms at once.*)

**[\
]{.underline}**

**[World 5: The "fears" system]{.underline}**

**LEVEL 19 ():**

See that tile with the skeleton heart?

It will freeze you with fear

The only way to unfreeze

Is if the other cubito comes very near

(*Explains the fear-tile and how it freezes/unfreezes*)

**LEVEL 20 ():**

But you see, I have this fear,

I'll make a fool of myself

Maybe in another year

I could show you my better half

**LEVEL 21 ():**

But you see, I have this fear

I can't support you all the way

And I don't want to be the one

Who made you leave rather than stay

**LEVEL 22 ():**

But you see, I have this fear

That it's just too soon

Maybe in a year or two

I'm good enough to be your groom

**LEVEL 23 ():**

But you see, I have this fear,

That I will let you down

That I can't keep up the charade,

Of being strong, loving and comforting

Until our final dawn

**LEVEL 24 ():**

Then let me tell you something,

I once learnt from that witch in black

"Fear is the heart of love,"

And I never looked back

**[\
]{.underline}**

**[World 6: The "warmth" system]{.underline}**

**LEVEL 25 ():**

Then suddenly they saw a spectacle unfold

Grass to snow, ground to ice, warmth to cold

As both cubitos struggled to stay warm

The voice of the witch raised the alarm

"You must stay within four tiles of each other!

If you move too far way, then say goodbye to your lover!"

**LEVEL 26 ():**

Oh you see, I am so cold

I fear I may never recover

Warmth has but a fleeting hold

Like an empty bed where once lay my lover

**LEVEL 27 ():**

"Well this is what you get,"

The other replied in anger

"Why did you wait for this to happen?

Why did you postpone, deny and linger?"

**LEVEL 28 ():**

Why do you wait for witches?

A stroke of magic that brings you together?

It's just one step, a question, a leap,

And you could be happy forever after!

**[World 7: The "doubts" system]{.underline}**

**LEVEL 29 ():**

And the world reverted to normal,

Just as quickly as the icy storms came

As if the witch said: "finally,

You're playing the right game"

(*This is an intermediate level, before we go into the world of doubts. Seemed to fit well here, and I didn't have room for explaining doubts with the text above combined*.)

**Level 30 ():**

A new tile appeared, question marks all over

That witch, they thought, she sure knows her spells

With every move you make,

I teleport to somewhere else!

**Level 31 () :**

But you see, I have these doubts

Tearing me apart

If I marry you within a day

Will love never disappear from my heart?

**Level 32 ():**

But you see, I have these doubts

My future so uncertain

If I kiss you now, is it a gift?

Or a never-ending burden?

**Level 33 ():**

But you see, I have these doubts as well ... and maybe that's alright.

**[World 8: Mirrors]{.underline}**

**LEVEL 34 ():**

So I'll hold a piece of your heart

And you hold my other half

For when I see you,

I see so much of myself ...

(*First time with mirrors.*)

**LEVEL 35 ():**

And maybe on a bad day,

You might try to ignore me

But there\'s no escape from love:

You\'re everywhere I go, everyone I see

(*To hint players that mirrors are all around the level, and you will be spotted everywhere.*)

**LEVEL 36 ():**

And my fears flash by,

My doubts all over the place,

Is love really what they say it is?

It feels more like an unescapable maze

**LEVEL 37 ():**

That's why you must see, my dear,

Love is like the siren song

Your mind knows you mustn't answer the call

But your heart could never be so strong

**LEVEL 38 ():**

And when all is said and done,

And we're the only ones left on the stage

Could you honestly tell me you love me

And never wished for better days?

**LEVEL 39 ():**

And I don\'t believe in the existence of angels\
But looking at you I wonder if that\'s true

But if I did I would summon them together\
And ask them to watch over you

To each burn a candle for you\
To make bright and clear your path

And to walk, like Christ, in grace and love\
And guide you into my arms

*Into my arms, oh Lord*

**INTERESTING VIDEO:** 8 common game architecture/code mistakes

> **URL:** <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Hy4JvtfUb8>

**Mistake #1**: Having game logic inside the UI

-   Don't store/modify actual game data within the UI

-   Don't calculate/evaluate game logic within the UI

-   Instead, let the game logic call the UI manager whenever something changes/is needed

-   Also: if the menu has many different states, create a *state manager* for it. The state manager ensures the current state is always correct => once this state is determined, that's when it calls the UI to update it

**Mistake #2:** Having giant, monolithic, single classes

-   Don't put different functionality into the same class => 1000 lines is already a bit too much, more than that is most likely a problem

-   Why does it happen? At first, it's very easy: only a single file, don't need to connect/reference anything. It usually happens as a side-effect (it just grows over time)

-   Solution? Clean things as you're working. Split things into parts that make sense as you go.

-   If you see your class getting 200-300 lines long => investigate it! Is the class doing too many things?

**Mistake #3:** Having everything public

-   (This was mostly relevant for Unity3D. Too many things are exposed to the inspector => which means too many things become interconnected or data is lost. For example: you can't get the original value for something without referencing back to the original prefab.)

-   You only want things to be public if they are *intended to be used by another class*.

**Mistake #4:** Having setters with side-effects

-   If a setter isn't just *setting the value*, but doing other stuff as well, there will be problems in many ways.

-   Within that side-effect, something else might be happening. Thus, you get a chain reaction. (Or, that side-effect might take a lot of time, causing the whole setter to become slow/grind to a halt.)

-   It's NOT necessarily a problem to have a setter with side-effects, it's a problem to HIDE it.

-   Solution? Make setters extremely simple: just set/get something. If you want extra functionality, wrap a function around it that calls both the setter and the extra functionality.

**Mistake #5:** Giant Prefabs

-   Connected to the "large monolithic classes" problem => hard to re-use functionality, hard to maintain, hard to co-operate with others in a team.

-   Solution? Split prefabs into multiple smaller prefabs. Instead of making a UI a single prefab, make the prefab a collection of smaller scenes, each of which contains part of the UI. (*Nested prefabs*.)

-   Solution 2? Use prefab variants (Unity3D specific)

**Mistake #6:** Not using Interfaces (Unity3D specific). Using them too much is bad, using them too little is also bad.

-   Possible use case: A system that needs to interact with two different objects, but in the same (kind of) way

    -   You *could* put the same script/node/component on both objects, or just copy code. But you run into problems: e.g. a take damage function on a player and a crate, but the player needs to react *differently* to damage than the crate.

    -   Instead, find a common interface (like an "I take damage" or "I have health"). Give it a (public) method like take_damage(). Then you make both health components implement that interface -- but in different ways.

-   Another benefit: unit testing your code becomes dramatically easier.

-   **What are interfaces?** Kind of the same as class inheritance or extensions. Any class that shares an interface, must have all the methods/properties from that interface implemented. (The actual implementation, of course, can vary/be modified.)

    -   Unity introduction Interfaces: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50_qBoKGKxs>

    -   INHERITENCE: Class B **is a** Class A

    -   INTERFACES: Class B **implements** Class A

**Mistake #7:** Completely ignoring garbage collection and performance issues.

-   Of course, in tiny games, or Game Jam/Hackathon games, or the prototyping stage, it doesn't matter and nobody's going to notice.

-   Solution? Everytime you make a (significant) change, go in there and profile it. Every time.

-   Little things like a small/tiny performance decrease, don't sweat it. But when you see big problems (in architecture), or know there's a better way to solve something -- do it!

**Mistake #8:** Not sharing what you're doing (code/architecture) and not getting feedback.

This includes NOT looking at other people's architecture. If you only look at your own code, you'll never learn and you never grow.

Solution? Find source code for other games and inspect it!
